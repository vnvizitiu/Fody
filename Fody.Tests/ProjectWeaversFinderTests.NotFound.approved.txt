Could not file a FodyWeavers.xml at the project level (\FodyWeavers.xml). Some project types do not support using NuGet to add content files e.g. netstandard projects. In these cases it is necessary to manually add a FodyWeavers.xml to the project. Example content:
<Weavers>
  <WeaverName/>
</Weavers>
